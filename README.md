# SQLc plugin for the Dataloaders generation

This plugin is used to generate Facebook's dataloaders for each table in the database.
As a dataloader library we use [DataLoader](https://github.com/graph-gophers/dataloader) which is a Go implementation of Facebook's DataLoader.
This plugin works with the [SQLc](https://sqlc.dev/) code generator.
